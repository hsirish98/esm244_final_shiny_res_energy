main_ov <- "The purpose of this shiny app is to investigate the state of 
electrification of residenital energy consumption in the United States. 
We must reduce reliance on fossil fuels across all energy end uses in order
to avoid catastrophic climate impacts from GHG-emission caused warming of the atmosphere."

main_2p <- "Navigate to the tabs at the top of the page and learn about historical 
trends in consumption of different fuel sources for use in residential buildings,
a breakdown of consumption by region and by fuel source and end use, and the current state
of total electrification"

data_source <- "The data comes from the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA).
This organization publishes a Residential Energy Consumption Survey every year. Click on the 'About the
RECS' tab to see more information about this data."


RECS <- "The Residential Energy Consumption Survery (RECS)
is administered by the EIA to what they call a 'nationally representative
sample of housing units.' Energy usage and housing characteristics and 
demographics data are collected from the households. The EIA combines this 
data with data from energy suppliers to the homes to get estimates for the 
national use of energy overall, as well as for heating, cooling, appliance
use, etc."

dashboard <- "The RECS has data on energy consumption by fuel type dating back to 
1979. Every survey year, there is a report of the total households as well as the total
energy use in Btu used per fuel type. It is converted here to Megajoules (MJ). The graph shown here is a dashboard of the 
total energy use by fuel type from 1979 to 2015 (the most recent published survey year --
2020 data should be released in 2023). Click on the different fuel types to see
how consumption trends have changed over time, and how the total consumption has 
changed over time."
