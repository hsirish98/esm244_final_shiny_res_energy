electrification of residenital energy consumption in the United States. 
We must reduce reliance on fossil fuels across all energy end uses in order
to avoid catastrophic climate impacts from GHG-emission caused warming of the atmosphere."

main_2p <- "Navigate to the tabs at the top of the page and learn about historical 
trends in consumption of different fuel sources for use in residential buildings,
a breakdown of consumption by region and by fuel source and end use, and the current state
of total electrification"
